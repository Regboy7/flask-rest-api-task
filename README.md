⛽ Petrol Station Vehicle Incident Reporting System

This project is a small web app I built using Flask, SQLite, and a bit of HTML/CSS/JavaScript to simulate a database system used by petrol stations to record vehicles that have driven off without paying.

The idea is that when someone drives away without paying for fuel, the vehicle details (registration, make, model, year) can be recorded and stored. That data could then be sent or exported to bailiffs or external agencies for recovery.

It’s essentially a backend system with a simple web-based dashboard for managing the data — no complicated software needed.

An improvement I could make on this system is adding a login system where only authorised users can add or delete vehicles. This would make my system much more secure.

Run init_db.py to create database on any device.
Run app.py to start the app.
